		<h2>🌍 Traveling ✈️</h2>
		<p> 
			A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. So by traveling and going to someplace you have never been before you expand my cultural knowledge.

			Sometimes we get so comfortable in our lifes that we dont want to try new things. However the only way to discover new oceans is to have the courage of getting out of our comfort zone.
